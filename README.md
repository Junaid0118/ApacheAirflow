# 🚀 Apache Airflow ETL Pipeline  

This project demonstrates a **simple but powerful ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** built with **Apache Airflow**.  
The DAG orchestrates the flow of data from extraction to transformation and finally to loading into a clean CSV output.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🔹 **Automated ETL Pipeline** – fully managed by Airflow.  
- 🔹 **CSV-based Data Processing** using **Pandas**.  
- 🔹 **Task Orchestration** with XCom for passing data between tasks.  
- 🔹 **Retry & Alert Mechanism** – email notifications on failures.  
- 🔹 **Modular & Extensible** – easy to scale for real-world data workflows.

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview  

1. **Extract**  
   - Reads raw data from `deliveries.csv`.  
   - Pushes data into Airflow’s **XCom** for downstream tasks.  

2. **Transform**  
   - Cleans and filters the dataset (e.g., selecting `match_no`).  
   - Prepares structured data for loading.  

3. **Load**  
   - Writes transformed data into `output.csv`.  
   - Demonstrates how ETL pipelines persist clean outputs.

## 🛠️ DAG Code (Simplified)

```python
with DAG(
    dag_id='etl_csv_pipeline',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='Simple ETL DAG with CSV',
    start_date=datetime(2025, 8, 25),
    schedule='@daily',
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    extract_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='extract_task',
        python_callable=extract,
    )

    transform_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='transform_task',
        python_callable=transform,
    )

    load_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='load_task',
        python_callable=load,
    )

    extract_task >> transform_task >> load_task
````

## 📊 DAG Visualization

Here’s how the pipeline looks in Airflow’s UI:

**Extract ➝ Transform ➝ Load**

```
extract_task ---> transform_task ---> load_task
```

## 📧 Notifications & Reliability

* Configured with **retry policies** (`retries=2`, `retry_delay=1 minute`).
* **Email alerts** enabled (`email_on_failure=True`).
* Ensures robustness in production scenarios.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ApacheAirflowDay01.git
cd ApacheAirflowDay01
```

### 2️⃣ Start Airflow

```bash
airflow standalone
```

### 3️⃣ Add DAG

* Place `etl_csv_pipeline.py` into your **`dags/`** folder.

### 4️⃣ Trigger the DAG

* In Airflow UI → Trigger DAG `etl_csv_pipeline`.
* Or run:

```bash
airflow dags trigger etl_csv_pipeline
```

---

## 🌟 Learning Outcomes

* Hands-on with **Apache Airflow DAGs**.
* Using **PythonOperator** with Pandas for data processing.
* Understanding **XComs** for inter-task communication.
* Applying **retry & notification** strategies for reliability.
